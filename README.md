### 📌 What you’ll find here

A growing set of UI components and layouts built to showcase strong front-end fundamentals, visual consistency, and reusable patterns.

## ✨ Purpose

This repository is not a tutorial or a single website.  
It is a **UI showcase** built to demonstrate:

- Solid HTML semantics  
- Clean and maintainable CSS  
- Responsive layouts  
- Reusable UI patterns  
- Attention to visual detail  

Each component lives in its own folder and can be reused independently.

## 🧩 Components

Each component is designed as an independent, reusable UI block.

Every component folder includes:

- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- Optional preview image or GIF  

Components are **self-contained**, making them easy to copy, reuse, or adapt.

---

## 🖼️ Previews

Visual previews help quickly understand the component’s layout, style, and intent without opening the code.

> These previews are especially useful for portfolio websites and project cards.
